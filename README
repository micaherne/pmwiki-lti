LTI Interface For PMWiki
------------------------

This script provides a very basic Full LTI compliant interface to PMWiki to allow it to be used as a standalone wiki tool from any LTI consumer.

It was created as an entry for the EILE Project Full LTI challenge at dev8D 2011 (http://wiki.2011.dev8d.org/w/Bounties#Enabling_Integrated_Learning_Environments_.28EILE.29_Project_.28JISC_Funded.29). It is intended as a demonstration of how LTI registration and launch can be applied to an existing tool, rather than as a fully-featured LTI-compliant wiki implementation.

The code is based on the Full LTI Wordpress implementation by the EILE Project at the University of Kent (http://blogs.kent.ac.uk/eile/)

Requirements
------------

PHP 5.3 with SOAP extension

Installation
------------

1. Download a copy of PMWiki (http://www.pmwiki.org/) and install it at http://localhost/pmwiki
2. Copy the script lti.php into the root of the pmwiki directory.
3. Create a directory called lti_consumers in the root of the pmwiki directory and make sure that your local webserver has permissions to write to it.

Usage
-----

Point your LTI consumer at http://localhost/pmwiki/lti.php?action=register to register the tool.
